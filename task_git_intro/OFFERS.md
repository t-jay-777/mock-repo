# Offers for course improvment

I was amazed by [this site](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). So I suggest to add this resource to git-intro course. It explains git in easy way and doesn't bind to files.

One more great [source](https://githowto.com/). It is avaible in English, Ukrainian, Russian, Portugal.
